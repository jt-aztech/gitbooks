# ðŸ¤¹ Puell Multiple

The Puell Multiple is a Bitcoin metric focused on miners' revenue, assessing market cycles from the supply side of Bitcoin's economy. Since miners face fixed costs in a volatile market, they often act as compulsory sellers, impacting Bitcoin's price over time. The Puell Multiple is calculated by dividing the daily issuance value of Bitcoin (in USD) by its 365-day moving average, highlighting periods when mining revenue is unusually high or low relative to historical norms. During high revenue periods (indicated by a red zone on the chart), it can signal advantageous points for investors to take profits, as these align with Bitcoin price peaks. Conversely, low revenue periods (green zone) have historically presented profitable buying opportunities, making the Puell Multiple a valuable tool for predicting potential price reversals in Bitcoinâ€™s market.
