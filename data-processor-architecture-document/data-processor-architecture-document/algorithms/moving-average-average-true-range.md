# 🖇️ Moving Average - Average True Range

The Moving Average - Average True Range (MA-ATR) algorithm calculates the moving average (MA) and the average true range (ATR) at a given price point. It then determines the number of ATR multipliers between the moving average and the price at that point. These multipliers are subsequently normalized.
