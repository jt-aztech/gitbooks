# ðŸŽ¼ Algorithms

Each algorithm can be configured with specific parameters, allowing for tailored processing.

Key features of the algorithms include:

1. **Flexibility:** There is no limit to the number of algorithms that can be created and utilized. This flexibility ensures that the service can handle any complexity of data analysis required.
2. **Configurable Parameters:** Each algorithm comes with a set of configurable parameters, enabling fine-tuning, curve-fitting and precise control over its behavior and output.
3. **Strategy Integration:** Algorithms can be combined in any configuration and attached to strategies. This means that a single strategy can leverage multiple algorithms which can be individually configured, working in tandem to process data points and historical datasets effectively.
4. **Customization:** The customizable nature of the algorithms ensures that they can adapt to specific use cases, making them suitable for a variety of data processing scenarios.

By allowing any number of algorithms and combinations, the Data Processor Service ensures comprehensive and adaptable data analysis.
