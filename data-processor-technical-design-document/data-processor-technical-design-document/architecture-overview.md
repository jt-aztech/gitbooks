# üè´ Architecture Overview

The architecture of the data processor is centered around the Vert.x framework, chosen for its asynchronous and non-blocking event-driven model, facilitating high concurrency and scalability. This lightweight runtime provides an efficient platform for building reactive applications.

#### Key Components:

1. **Vert.x Framework**:
   * **Asynchronous and Non-blocking**: Enables high concurrency and efficient resource utilization.
   * **Event-driven Model**: Supports building scalable and responsive applications.
2. **Database**:
   * **MongoDB**: Selected for its schema-less storage capabilities, allowing flexible and dynamic data management without predefined schemas. This enables the data processor to efficiently handle diverse and evolving data structures.
3. **API Gateway**:
   * **Nginx**: Used to route requests, providing load balancing, reverse proxying, and security features such as rate limiting and IP whitelisting. Nginx ensures efficient and secure communication between the client and backend services.
4. **Monitoring and Performance**:
   * **Prometheus**: Facilitates metrics collection for system health and performance monitoring.
   * **Grafana**: Visualizes these metrics through comprehensive dashboards, providing real-time insights and alerts.
