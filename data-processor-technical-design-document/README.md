# üõ†Ô∏è Data Processor Technical Design Document

The architecture of the data processor is centered around the Vert.x framework, chosen for its asynchronous and non-blocking event-driven model, which facilitates high concurrency and scalability. This lightweight runtime provides an efficient platform for building reactive applications.

MongoDB is selected for its schema-less storage capabilities, allowing flexible and dynamic data management without predefined schemas. This choice enables the data processor to handle diverse data structures efficiently.

Nginx is used as an API gateway to route requests. It provides load balancing, reverse proxying, and security features such as rate limiting and IP whitelisting. By using Nginx, we ensure efficient and secure communication between the client and the backend services.

System health and performance monitoring are achieved through Prometheus metrics and Grafana dashboards, providing real-time insights and comprehensive monitoring capabilities.
